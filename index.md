# Welcome to my website!

**About me:** I am a biomedical engineer and data scientist with 5+ years of experience leveraging Python, R, and machine learning methods to analyze complex biomedical datasets (including time-series data). I have demonstrated ability to develop computational tools and effectively communicate findings to diverse audiences. I hold a BS/MSE in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I was a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health. Currently, I work at BRAIV as a Biomedical Data Scientist.

## NIMH Research Projects

### Real-time Ecological Assessment of the Context of mental and physical Health (REACH)
**Innovation:** This smartphone applet tracks various domains across physical, mental, and behavioral health, including mood, sleep, physical activity. Its comprehensive nature allows exploration of various correlates of mental illness.\
**My role:** I collaborated with researchers and engineers at the Child Mind Institute to provide feedback on content and response structuring/conditional logic. I initiated the development of this applet's associated data processing pipeline, which transforms the data from its raw form into a format that can be more easily analyzed.\
**Results:** I am a co-author on a manuscript of this work submitted to *npj Digital Medicine*. A preprint of this work can be found [here](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/85667).

### Associations Between Empirically Derived Symptom Profiles of ADHD and Mood Disorders
**Innovation:** This work examines associations between symptom patterns of ADHD and mood disorders, potentially allowing us to identify targets for early intervention of bipolar disorder.\
**My role:** I helped generate the experimental questions, preprocessed the data and imputed missing values, and derived the ADHD symptom patterns using a statistical clustering method.\
**Results:** I presented this work at the NIMH Three-Minute Talk Competition. I am also drafting a first-author manuscript that is currently in preparation.

### Correlates of Diurnal Patterns of Cortisol
**Innovation:** This work examines cortisol release patterns across the lifespan. It also examines how these release patterns are associated with other psychological and biological domains, such as mood and sleep.\
**My role:** I integrated mood (captured through self-report diary entries administered on mobile devices) with salivary cortisol measurements to analyze associations between these data.\
**Results:** I presented this work at four conferences.

## Miscellaneous

### Gait Analyzer Shiny App
While at Johns Hopkins, I took a course on data science for biomedical engineers. As part of that class, I collaborated with a classmate to create a Shiny app to predict neurological disorder based on time-series gait data. More information can be found below:

* [Github Repository](https://github.com/ananyas713/DataSci_FinalProject) 

### Nerds in Harmony
During my time at the NIMH, I participated in Nerds in Harmony, an NIH acappella group. We presented at various venues, including the NIH Clinical Center and the Smithsonian National Zoo. You can find a video of us performing [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf_hxJ5Qzkw)
