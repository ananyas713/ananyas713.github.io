# Welcome to my website!

**About me:** I am a biomedical engineer and data scientist with 5+ years of experience leveraging Python, R, and machine learning methods to analyze complex biomedical datasets (including time-series data). I have demonstrated ability to develop computational tools and effectively communicate findings to diverse audiences. I hold a BS/MSE in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I was a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health. Currently, I work at BRAIV as a Biomedical Data Scientist.

### Real-time Ecological Assessment of the Context of mental and physical Health (REACH)
**Innovation:** This smartphone applet tracks various domains across physical, mental, and behavioral health, including mood, sleep, physical activity. Its comprehensive nature allows exploration of various correlates of mental illness.\
**My role:** I collaborated with researchers and engineers at the Child Mind Institute to provide feedback on content and response structuring/conditional logic. I initiated the development of this applet's associated data processing pipeline, which transforms the data from its raw form into a format that can be more easily analyzed.\
**Results:** I am a co-author on a manuscript of this work submitted to *npj Digital Medicine*. A preprint of this work can be found [here](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/85667).
